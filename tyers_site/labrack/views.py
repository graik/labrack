## R: I tried to bring some order into the import statements
## Todo -- Code cleanup:
## ** put all javascript-related methods into a separate viewJavascript module
## ** put all CVS export / import methods into a separate viewCVS module
## ** the indentation was set to 8 -- normal coding style is 4.
## ** remove example, unused and commented-out code (see comments below)
## ** simplify, shorten import statements (see comments)
## ** remove un-used imports
